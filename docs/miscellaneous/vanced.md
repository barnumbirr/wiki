## Configuration

### Using YouTubeâ„¢ Vanced with Google Workspace

Using Vanced in conjunction with a Google Workspace (formerly Google G Suite)
account results in Vanced returning the error
`Please check your internet connection` as well as the newly added account being
greyed out and unselectable.

All "fixes" trying to remove the account from the Google app and uninstalling
both Youtube Vanced and MicroG fail.

To allow Vanced to connect to your Google Workspace account, do the following:

1. Log in to the [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/).
2. Choose **Devices**, then in the left navigation bar choose
**Settings > Universal Settings**.
3. In the *General* section, choose **Mobile management**.
4. Select **Turn off mobile management (Unmanaged)**.

You should now be able to use your Google Workspace account to login to Vanced.
