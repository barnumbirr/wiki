Lube is the best way to enhance the smoothness of the switches on your
mechanical keyboard. Here's a non-exhaustive list of the most popular lubes.
When lubing switches, remember that less is more and light applications are
recommended for the best results.

### Krytox™ VPF-1514

Low-viscosity perfluoropolyether (PFPE) lubricating oil.  
Cheaper option to GPL range.  
Suitable for switch springs or as a thinner when combined with NLGI grade 2
greases (203g2, 204g2 or 205g2) to produce hybrid lubes such as ‘GH V4’.

### Krytox™ GPL 105

High-viscosity perfluoropolyether (PFPE) lubricating oil.  
Medium viscosity in GPL range, most popular option.  
Suitable for switch springs or tactile switches.

### Krytox™ GPL 107

High-viscosity perfluoropolyether (PFPE) lubricating oil.  
Second-highest viscosity of any available Krytox general-purpose oils.  
Suitable for switch springs or heavy, worn or uneven linear switches.  
Not suitable for tactile or clicky switches.
