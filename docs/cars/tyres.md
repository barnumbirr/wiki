## Makes and models

### Michelin

#### Pilot Sport 3

The PS3 promises fantastic road holding through corners, superb efficiency and
impressive tyre life. A good every-day road road tyre.

#### Pilot Super Sport

A fast road tyre suitable for occasional track use. Whether you’re accelerating
flat out in a straight line or cornering at high speed, you still get optimum
grip. When cornering, the shape of the contact patch changes but the amount of
rubber in contact with the road surface stays the same.

#### Pilot Sport 4 S

The new generation of road tyre from Michelin, suitable for normal road use and
replaces the highly popular and highly rated Michelin Pilot Super Sport,
released back in 2011.. Continuously adapts to the road, optimising contact for
better handling and fuel efficiency. “Dynamic response” technology: a hybrid
belt of aramid and nylon ensures the optimum transmission between steering
instruction and the road.

#### Pilot Sport Cup 2

Michelin's road legal track tyre, fantastic on track but still performs very
well on the road. Slower wear of the outer shoulder and reinforced external
shoulder with special rubber - highly resistant to abrasion for improved
endurance / track longevity.

### Bridgestone

!!! note
    Cooked after 4 laps at Spa-Francorchamps in 25° weather using 1.8/1.7 bar

## Tyre pressures

The recommended pressures are given for cold tyres.
In case of high temperatures (circuits/tyre), you are recommended to reduce the
front tyre pressures. RenaultSport recommend not exceeding 2.5 bars when hot at
the front.

!!! note
    Do not forget to readjust the tyre pressures before leaving the circuit to
    avoid damaging the tyres and to comply with regulations!  
    The recommended circuit pressures are less than the minimum legal pressures
    on road and increase fuel consumption.

### Adjustments

|                      |Front (bars) |Rear (bars) |
|--------------------- |------------ |----------- |
|In case of understeer |             |+0.2        |
|In case of oversteer  |             |-0.2        |

!!! note
    - In case of understeer upon corner entry, RenaultSport recommend increasing
     the rear tyre pressures.  
    - To reduce oversteer, decrease the rear tyre pressures.

### Mégane IV R.S Trophy

After switching to Michelin Pilot Sport 4 S XL (245/35 R19 Y93), try the
following pressures:

|                      |Front (bars) |Rear (bars) |
|--------------------- |------------ |----------- |
|Road Set-up (Sport)   |2.2          |2.0         |
